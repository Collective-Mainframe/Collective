# Building
## **1. Add Collective Matrix to sources.**

Use `Ctrl + L` in the browser of your choice and type:
```bash
https://discord.gg/collective
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable Collective version by right clicking on the server icon and confirming the ID matches:

```bash
583599626280632320
```
Note that if this is not the latest Collective version on your machine, you may require an override. Use `Ctrl + L` in the browser of your choice and type:
```bash
https://discord.gg/VnU8apR
```

You may also use an interface called [Discord](https://discord.com/).

**Warning:** your software must be up-to-date and have functioned for a certain period of time or otherwise [Wick](https://wickbot.com/) will terminate your connection.

## **2. Verify your connection.**
Upon successful completion of the previous step, [Auttaja](https://auttaja.io/) will send you up-to-date instructions on verifying your connection. Please ensure you are not blocking the connection to Auttaja.
## **3. Download the source code.**
Locate `#public_interface` and type the following command:
```bash
.join
```
A new interface will be opened for your download process. Please follow the instructions in it to customize your installation.

## **4. Build.**
Type the following within the installation interface:
```bash
.submit
```
Collective Matrix usually takes 1-3 days to approve your connection. During times of high traffic, this may also take up to a week.

**Warning:** if a failure is detected in your installation process, your connection may be terminated. If the error can be fixed, instructions will be sent to you within the installation interface.
